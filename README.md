# LLC_Resonant_Converter_Design
This repository will showcase the theory behind the operation of an LLC resonant converter and a working MATLAB code.
In this project we will use a document created by Texas Instruments, to design an LLC resonant converter. You can find a lot of documentation 
online for reference.
The Texas Instruments documentation was selected because it has a clear and in depth explanation of all the concepts that are necessary
to gain an understanding of LLC converters. The Texas Instruments document also has a solved example which can be of great use practically.
